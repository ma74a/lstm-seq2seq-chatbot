Create a focal point - Use either the fireplace or windows as your primary focal point. Arrange your main seating (sofa) to face or be perpendicular to this feature.  \n\n2. Traffic flow - Keep 30-36\" pathways through the room. Avoid placing furniture where it blocks natural movement between doors.  \n\n3. Conversation areas - Position seating so people can comfortably talk (no more than 8 feet apart). A U-shaped or H-shaped seating arrangement works well.  \n\n4. Symmetry vs. balance - If using the fireplace as focal point, you might place matching chairs on either side. For asymmetrical arrangements, ensure visual weight is distributed evenly.  \n\n5. Area rug placement - Use a large rug (at least 8×10) to anchor the seating area with all furniture front legs on the rug.  \n\nWould you like me to suggest a specific layout based on your furniture pieces, or would you like to try our virtual room planner tool?"

    },
    {
      "input": "How do I choose the right bar stools?",
